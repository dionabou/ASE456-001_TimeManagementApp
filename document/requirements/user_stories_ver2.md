# User Stories - Version 2 (Ver2)

This document outlines the user stories derived from Jack's second email. These user stories represent the requirements for the additional features requested after the initial implementation.

## Epic 1: Generate Reports
- **As a student, I want to generate reports about my time usage so that I can analyze my activity patterns over time.**

### User Stories:
1. **Report by Date Range**
   - As a user, I want to input a start date and an end date so that I can generate a report of all tasks performed during that period.

2. **Report on Time Allocation**
   - As a user, I want to see a summary of how much time I have spent on different tasks so that I can identify where most of my time is going.

3. **Report on Task Prioritization**
   - As a user, I want a prioritized list of tasks based on the total time spent so that I can focus on the most time-consuming activities.

## Epic 2: Enhanced Query Features
- **As a student, I want advanced querying capabilities so that I can retrieve more specific task details.**

### User Stories:
1. **Filter by Time**
   - As a user, I want to filter tasks by time range (e.g., tasks between 09:00 and 12:00) so that I can focus on specific periods.

2. **Multi-Criteria Query**
   - As a user, I want to query tasks using multiple criteria (e.g., tasks on a specific date with a specific tag) so that I can refine my search results.

---

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The application must allow users to input date ranges to generate reports.
2. Reports should include:
   - Total time spent on tasks during the specified range.
   - Breakdown of time by task and tag.
   - A prioritized list of tasks based on total time spent.
3. Enhanced querying features must support filtering by time range and combining multiple criteria.
4. All new features must be integrated seamlessly into the existing system.
